    "text-1": "colorbit® is our proprietary automatic recognition code. It can recognize not only continuous lines like straight, zigzag, and spiral patterns but also freely designed shapes.",
    "text-2": "Instead of reading each individual code, it performs batch recognition of all codes within the screen. This unique technology can be used in scenarios where it was challenging to apply two-dimensional codes such as barcodes, QR codes, RFID, and beacons."
